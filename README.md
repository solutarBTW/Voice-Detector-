# Voice Detector using MATLAB – DSP Project

This project implements a **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** system using MATLAB. It is developed for a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course and is capable of identifying the presence or absence of voice in an audio signal based on amplitude thresholds and energy levels.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎙️ Audio signal input (e.g., recorded or uploaded voice samples)  
- 📈 Signal preprocessing and segmentation  
- 📊 Voice activity detection using energy/amplitude thresholding  
- 📉 Time-domain visualization of detected voice segments  
- ✅ Simple and intuitive logic for speech detection  

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Updated_code.mlx` – Main MATLAB Live Script containing the complete voice detection logic and visualization  
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)  

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or later  
- **Signal Processing Toolbox** (recommended for some advanced functions)  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open **MATLAB**  
2. Navigate to the folder containing `Updated_code.mlx`  
3. Open the file and click **Run**  
4. Follow prompts to select or load an audio file if required  

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure your audio input is clean and properly sampled (e.g., `.wav` file, mono, 8kHz or higher).
- You can modify the detection threshold or windowing settings in the script to improve accuracy.
